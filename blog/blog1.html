        <p class="lead mb-4">The newest smart contract programming language, Vyper, has developers wondering, "Is this the end for Solidity?" or "Will I need to learn a whole new language just to maintain my current projects?"</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">No need to keep you in suspense as this is not the case. Vyper is an additional option, not a forced replacement, in the smart contract developer toolkit.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">"Great! Something new to make my smart contracts better," you might be thinking. But what are the differences and how can your smart contracts benefit from using Vyper over Solidity?</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Well hold on to your shorts because we'll be covering all that and more to introduce you to Vyper smart contract development</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">The Backdrop for Ethereum</h2>

        <p class="lead mb-4">As governments and large companies move closer towards nationalism and centralization, cryptocurrency projects like Ethereum are developing a platform to build new models of open finance and decentralized governance. So far, the <a href="https://academy.ivanontech.com/blog/decentralized-finance-what-is-defi-and-why-do-we-need-it" target="_blank"> DeFi movement</a> and various <a href="https://bankless.substack.com/p/how-to-start-a-moloch-dao" target="_blank"> DAO projects</a>, like <a href="https://www.metacartel.org/" target="_blank">MetaCartel</a>, are the results of these efforts.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">However, this is only the beginning. Ethereum is a globally decentralized, peer-to-peer, internet infrastructure. As it continues to grow and restore ownership of personal data and money to users of the platform, it reduces the control of centralized entities.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">In order to carry out the instructions of these projects over this decentralized network, Ethereum uses smart contracts. These smart contracts have traditionally been written in the Solidity programming language.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Enter Solidity</h2>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Solidity is popularly used on the Ethereum blockchain and was inspired by the C++, Python, and JavaScript programming languages.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>“Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.”</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer"><a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.1/" target="_blank">Solidity Documentation</a></footer>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Smart contracts are like classes found in other object-oriented programming languages. Except instead of acting as a blueprint for creating objects, like traditional classes, smart contracts act as self-enforcing, digital agreements for using a program or app. It's also important to note that anyone on the network can interact and view smart contracts built on Ethereum.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">This means smart contracts can store, carry out, and enforce agreements between users. And since they live on the blockchain, anyone can review the terms before using an app built using a smart contract. Despite this big difference, Solidity still shares many features found in other object-oriented programming languages.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-2">Three key features that Solidity has adopted as an object-oriented programming language are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encapsulation</li>
          <li>Inheritance</li>
          <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead mt-4 mb-4">Encapsulation allows smart contracts to be built like classes in other programming languages. Data types and methods within classes are defined by the developer. Similarly, the data types and functions in a smart contract are also defined by the developer. As a result, smart contracts act as self-contained components that can be deployed as separate instances on the blockchain.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Inheritance allows smart contracts to inherit data types and functions from other smart contracts. This mirrors the parent-child inheritance relationship seen in single inheritance structures found in other object-oriented programming languages. Multi-level, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance are also supported in Solidity.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">This offers some flexibility and modularity, as one smart contract does not have to contain every data type or function that is called. This allows for the implementation of upgradable smart contracts.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">A core feature of blockchain, including the Ethereum blockchain, is immutability. Once deployed onto the blockchain, data cannot be altered or removed by an external authority. As a result, smart contracts cannot be modified after they are deployed. However, developers can “upgrade” their smart contracts through inheritance.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Polymorphism facilitates this by allowing users to interact with different child contract instances and still derive the expected values held by the parent contract.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Each child contract can have unique functionality, but they also share inherited functionality from the parent contract. This means users can call on the shared functionality from a child contract instance without knowing the state or address of the parent contract.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Combining these features allows us to upgrade smart contracts by deploying new child contracts with upgraded functionality that inherit from the same parent contract as the previous child contracts. The parent contract can store necessary data, and a second child, with a known address, can redirect calls to the newly deployed child contract that has been upgraded.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block mb-2" src="../img/HierInheritance.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="mb-5 text-center">Hierarchical Inheritance. Source: Tech Geek, <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-and-object-oriented-programming-oop-191f8deb8316" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</div>

        <p class="lead mb-4">The Solidity programming language is widely used in smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. However, a new programming language, Vyper, is being introduced to Ethereum.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Though still in beta, Vyper strives to increase smart contract security and reduce the chance of writing misleading code. In this attempt, its range of features will be limited compared to the features found in Solidity.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Enter Vyper</h2>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Vyper focuses on smart contract security, auditability, and simplicity.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>“Vyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).”</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer"><a href="https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Vyper Documentation</a></footer>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Vyper is contract-oriented instead of object-oriented. Smart contracts in Vyper are held in files. Each file holds one smart contract. These files are comparable to classes in object-oriented languages.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">As stated in its documentation, Vyper is most heavily influenced by Python. This is visible in its syntax. </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Python script: <br/>
          <code>python filename.py</code>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Vyper script: <br/>
          <code>vyper filename.vy</code>
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">In fact, Vyper’s syntax is also valid Python 3 syntax. However, the features found in Vyper are very limited compared to Python. This is done by intention to reduce the occurrence of bugs in the smart contract code.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Maximizing auditability is a design goal with the same intention. By making Vyper code more human-readable, the hope is to decrease the likelihood mistakes are overlooked.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Vyper focuses on increased security and readability through a minimalist approach. While Solidity offers more robustness, Vyper aims for simplicity.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">This is in response to the immutable nature of smart contracts on the blockchain. While it is possible to create upgradable smart contracts in Solidity to fix errors, this is not a reasonable expectation in every case.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Also, smart contracts often handle large sums of financial assets, so small mistakes can still be critical ones. Since the blockchain is immutable, there is no easy way to correct these errors after deployment. </p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">Therefore, Vyper limits the tools available to developers to reduce the frequency of these errors.</p>


        <div class="container">
          <p class="lead pb-3">Below are notable in Solidity that are <u><b>not</b></u> found in Vyper:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>modifiers</li>
            <li>class inheritance</li>
            <li>inline assembly</li>
            <li>function overloading</li>
            <li>operator overloading</li>
            <li>recursive calling</li>
            <li>infinite-length loops</li>
            <li>binary fixed point</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <p class="lead pb-3 pt-3">However, Vyper <u><b>does</b></u> support the following features: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>bounds and overflow checking</li>
            <li>support for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbers</li>
            <li>decidability</li>
            <li>strong typing</li>
            <li>small and understandable compiler code</li>
            <li>limited support for pure functions </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="lead mt-5 mb-4">Is Ethereum trading Solidity out for Vyper? What are the differences between these two programming languages? Why add a new language at all? Ethereum's Solidity vs Vyper debate has led to many questions about the future of the platform. Fortunately, we have the answers!</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">First of all, Vyper will not replace Solidity. Vyper aims to improve smart contract security. But, as a result, it lacks the robustness of Solidity. This exchange makes each language better suited for different use cases.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Before diving into the pros and cons of these languages, it'll help to understand the purpose of Ethereum as a whole.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Ethereum has grown exponentially since its start in 2015. Its use case has also evolved since then. From the ICO boom of 2017 to the current growth of DeFi, Ethereum continues to expand.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">However, this soaring expansion also comes with increased threats to security. The biggest threat to security is the potential for human error. As the DAO hack of 2016 showed us, there is a lot at stake when mistakes are made.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">Writing code has always required mistakes in order to learn what works and doesn't work. That model doesn't work well with millions of dollars on the line though. It's impossible to stop people from making mistakes, but it is possible to limit those mistakes by reducing the number of ways they can be made.</p>

        <p>I'm constantly learning more about the latest blockchain developments and technologies. When I do make time, I like to participate in a weekend discussion group that ranges in topics. Depending on the attendees discussions have included world &amp; local politics, finance, medicine science, computer security, and business. I enjoy attending local developer meetups at PunchCode and presenting new projects on their Demo Day event.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures. I've had the opportunity to learn a lot about Chinese culture during my time as a VIPKid teacher, where I taught Chinese kids online. My father is from Spain, so I speak Spanish, but I would like to visit in order to solidify my fluency as I don't practice it often.</p>
